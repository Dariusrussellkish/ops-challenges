# Tagup Back-End Advanced Coding Exercise

Thanks for your interest in joining our team! In this exercise, you will create a minimalistic web application meant to receive sensor data and report statistics. It is intended to evaluate your technical abilities in advance of an extended interview, and shouldnâ€™t take more than a few hours to complete.

## Technical Requirements

Please implement a horizonatally-scalable service to collect sensor data and
report statistics. Each server instance should have four routes:
- `POST /data` should accept JSON documents in the request body, with the form
    `[{"sensor": <str: sensor_id>, "timestamp": <str: iso 8601 timestamp>, "value": <float>}]`
  - The sensor id is a string describing the sensor that generated the data. A single request can include data from multiple sensors.
  - The timestamp is an ISO 8601 string indicating when the data was collected. Timestamps may be represented in local time where the data is captured.
  - Value is the sensor value, represented in floating point.
- `GET /statistics/<sensor id>` should return a JSON document in the response body of the form 
  `{"last_measurement": <str: iso 8601 timestamp>, "count": <int>,
  "avg": <float>}`. 
    - the `last_measurement` value should be the time of the last measurement posted to `/data` (the time included in the request body, *not* the time the request was made)
    - the `count` value should be the total number of measurements received by the server.
    - the `avg` value should be the arithmetic average of all values received for the sensor by the server.
- `DELETE /statistics/<sensor id>` should clear any statistics for the sensor with the given ID, and the response should not include a body.
- `GET /healthz` should return a 204 response with no body if the server is
    ready to receive requests, and should not return a 200 response if the
    server is not ready.

The server should be implemented in Python, in whatever web framework you are most comfortable in (e.g. Flask or FastAPI). It should be containerized using Docker, and should be deployable using Kubernetes.  For the purposes of this exercise, data does not need to persist across server restarts, but server responses should be correct even if there are multiple instances behind a load balancer (so an example architecture might include a central database or cache to act as a system of record).


## Deliverable

Your code should be containerized using docker. Please include a docker file that installs your dependencies and executes your server, listening for requests on port 8080. That is, we should be able to run your server by running 
```
docker build -t exercise:latest .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 exercise:latest
```
In addition, you should include a kubernetes manifest in YAML that creates a replica set with two instances of your service. We will build your docker image, push it to a private ECR repository, and deploy it using `kubectl apply -f <manifest.yaml>`; we will access your service using port forwarding. You do not need to configure an ingreess for TLS or external DNS accessibility.

Your submission should take the form of source code in a github reposiutory. If you do not have a github account, please create one. The github repository can be public or private; if private, please invite the following github users to collaborate:
- [wrvb](https://github.com/wrvb)

If your submission includes any functionality not captured in the docker image (such as tests or documentation) please describe the functionality in a README.md file.

## Tips

While this is only an exercise, try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code. Show us how you create clean and maintainable code that produces the target result. Build something that we'd be happy to contribute to.

In particular, we value clearly structured and well-documented code, designed for testability, maintainability, and performance. Adhere to PEP8 if possible, and use consistent naming schemes.

Feel free to add more features: we're curious about what you can think of. Consider how you might incorporate logging, monitoring, access control, persistence, and scalability. We'd expect the same if you worked with us!
